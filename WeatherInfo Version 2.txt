My attempts of making the program better:
I discovered that you can actually retrieve the weather of the city without coordinates and just by the name,
so it made the code a little cleaner i would say.

Another improvements:

Option of picking the unit of measurement(if not picked,it will use Kelvin as default unit)

Errors handling: If you dont pass the name of the city - you will be warned about it. Also the program checks if such city exists,otherwise it will warn the user.

Now the program tells you the weather,temp AND the speed of the wind

Program is now continuous: upon receiving the weather info of the city,you will be asked if you want to continue.You can choose to look at another city or close the program
